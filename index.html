Dear Oluwaferanmi,

I came across the words above sometime in 2022 on book.poets Instagram’s page (https://www.instagram.com/p/B-6DmWXAsnD/?igsh=MTJlMnQ0cWNmM3VvYQ== ) and guess whose face immediately came to mind? You guessed right—you. I still lose control every time I see your smile. The first time I hugged you, I panicked as per, what do you mean you’re hugging a girl who served you breakfast before you resumed back to school but it is a way of letting you know that even if I was hurt then, you still matter to me and I love you.

For a long time, I’ve wanted to tell you “I love you” vocally and then run away without waiting for your response, simply out of anxiety about what you might say next. And yea, I know the weight those words carry and it is not in me to carelessly throw them around as I mean each and every letter and the spaces in between the words.

Reflecting on Matthew 22:37, I once grappled with what it truly means to love God, but 1 John 2:5 helped me understand that loving God is shown through obedience and doing His will—it requires action in essence. In that same light, I promise to always put in the work that reflects the love I have for you. I am willing to devote the entirety of myself to you.

You are the person that comes to mind whenever I think of Proverbs 27:17. Thank you for being by my side all this while. Your happiness is my priority, and I pray daily for God’s strength to love you more and more. You hold a special place in my heart and I what I feel for you is genuine. I cherish you so much.

Forgive me if I may seem presumptuous, but one of my dreams is to see you wake up to handwritten love notes beneath your pillow or beside your lampstand. I truly see my future in you, and I pray for God’s leading and direction in all things.

Continue to steal my heart—it’s all yours. I love you, Oluwaferanmi Oluwabiyi ❤️

Happy Valentine’s Day 💌

With love, Your Admirer - Oluwapelumi (PhD in falling for Praise)
